# document_cutter

The project uses OpenCV's tools to find the largest contour on your photo. Basically it's a document.
So the program will find a document on your photo, suggest you a frame and save the cutted photo with your document like a document scanner does.

Install OpenCV before using. Fore example for MacOS with homebrew `brew install opencv`.
Give to the executable a path to your photo like `./DocScanner ./photo.jpg`
